👋 About This Repository

This repo documents my journey learning **C programming from the ground up**.
As a self-taught **Data Analyst** who made it into tech by learning tools like SQL, Power BI,
and Excel, I’m now diving deeper into **true programming fundamentals**.

C is the foundation of many modern languages and systems, so this repository serves as:

* A place to practice
* A place to experiment
* A place to build foundational programming intuition
* A resource for anyone else learning C and wanting to join in

Whether you're new to programming or refreshing your skills, you’re welcome here.

🎯 Goals

* Understand core computer science concepts through C
* Build projects from simple to intermediate
* Practice writing clean and readable code
* Learn memory management, pointers, functions, and data structures
* Track progress publicly for accountability and community contribution

---

🧠 What You’ll Find Here

* Basic C programs
* Experiments with functions, loops, arrays, pointers, and more
* Notes and explanations for concepts I found important
* Progressive examples as I build experience
* Small projects to apply learned skills

---

🤝 Contributing

If you're learning C or have experience and want to help — feel free to join in.

Ways to contribute:

* Suggest improvements
* Add beginner-friendly examples
* Share explanations and comments
* Help correct or optimize code
* Open issues with ideas or questions

This repo is meant to be open, welcoming, and supportive to anyone learning.

🛠️ Requirements

To run the C programs in this repo, you’ll need:

* A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
* A code editor (VS Code recommended)
* Basic command-line knowledge

---

🚀 How to Run the Code

Compile a file (example using GCC):

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
```

Run it:

```bash
./filename
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\filename.exe
```

📈 Why C?

C teaches you what programming really is:

* How memory works
* How variables are stored
* What a pointer really does
* How computers execute instructions
* Why higher-level languages work the way they do

Understanding C helps you become a **stronger, more confident programmer** in any language.
